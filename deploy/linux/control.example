Description: View and analyse the contents of music audio files
 Sonic Visualiser is an application for viewing and analysing the contents of mu
sic audio files. It was developed at the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary,
 University of London. Our aim is for it to be the first program you reach for w
hen want to study a musical recording rather than simply listen to it.
 We hope Sonic Visualiser will be of particular interest to musicologists, archi
vists, signal-processing researchers and anyone else looking for a friendly way 
to take a look at what lies inside the audio file.
