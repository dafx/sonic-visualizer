To compile from source
----------------------

To build on a Unix-like system, run

$ ./configure && make

The following additional libraries are required or optional when
building the SV core libraries:

REQUIRED	Qt v4.6 or newer	http://qt-project.org/
REQUIRED	Vamp Plugin SDK	v2.x	http://www.vamp-plugins.org/
REQUIRED	Rubber Band Library	http://www.breakfastquay.com/rubberband/
REQUIRED	libsndfile		http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
REQUIRED	libsamplerate		http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/
REQUIRED	FFTW3 			http://www.fftw.org/
REQUIRED	bzip2 library		http://www.bzip.org/
REQUIRED	Sord and Serd libraries	http://drobilla.net/software/

Optional	MAD mp3 decoder		http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/
Optional	Oggz and fishsound	http://xiph.org/oggz/
Optional        liblo OSC library	http://www.plugin.org.uk/liblo/

If you are going to build the rest of the SV libraries and the Sonic
Visualiser application, you will also need one or more of:

Optional	JACK			http://www.jackaudio.org/
Optional	PortAudio v19		http://www.portaudio.com/
Optional	PulseAudio    	 	http://www.pulseaudio.org/

Although JACK, PortAudio, and PulseAudio are individually optional,
you will need to have one or the other of them in order to get any
audio playback.  Usually JACK is preferred on Linux, with PulseAudio
as a backup, and PortAudio is used elsewhere.

On Linux, you will need the ALSA libraries (used for MIDI).

If you happen to be using a Debian-based Linux, you probably want to
apt-get install something like the following packages: libqt4-dev
libsndfile1-dev libsamplerate0-dev fftw3-dev libbz2-dev libjack-dev
libmad0-dev liboggz1-dev libfishsound1-dev libasound2-dev liblo0-dev
liblrdf0-dev libsord0-dev libserd0-dev.
